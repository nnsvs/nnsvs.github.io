NNSVS
=====

Neural network based singing voice synthesis library

- GitHub: https://github.com/nnsvs/nnsvs
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15987
- Demo: https://r9y9.github.io/projects/nnsvs/


Features
--------

- **Open-source**: NNSVS is fully open-source. You can create your own voicebanks with your dataset.
- **Multiple languages**: NNSVS has been used for creating singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems for multiple languages by VocalSynth comminities (8+ as far as I know).
- **Research friendly**: NNSVS comes with reproducible Kaldi/ESPnet-style recipes. You can use NNSVS to create baseline systems for your research.

Tools
-----

Note that NNSVS was originally designed for research purposes. Please check out more user-friendly tools below if you are neither a researcher nor a software developer.

- `ENUNU <https://github.com/oatsu-gh/ENUNU>`_
- `Simple-ENUNU <https://github.com/oatsu-gh/SimpleEnunu>`_

You can find a practical guide for NNSVS/ENUNU at https://nnsvs.carrd.co/ (by `xuu <https://xuu.crd.co/>`_).
A detailed tutorial for for making voice banks can be found at `NNSVS Database Making Tutorial <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uMsepxbdUW65PfIWL1pt2OM6ZKa5ybTTJOpZ733Ht6s/edit?usp=sharing>`_ (by `PixProcuer <https://twitter.com/PixPrucer>`_).
